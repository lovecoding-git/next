Suspecting foul play at his father&#x27;s company Wayne/Powers Corporation, Terry meets Bruce Wayne and learns a secret identity hidden for decades. Now too old to battle injustice, Wayne is a bitter shell of his former self and refuses to help. So Terry does what any brash young kid would do: steal the Batsuit and take matters into his own hands! Vowing to avenge his father&#x27;s death, Terry dons the high-tech suit - tricked out with jetpacks for flying, a supersensitive microphone for eavesdropping and even camouflage capabilities - in search of his father&#x27;s assassin.</p><img src="http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/4/10842.jpg"/></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"show":{"id":504,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/504/batman-beyond","name":"Batman Beyond","type":"Animation","language":"English","genres":["Action","Adventure","Science-Fiction"],"status":"Ended","runtime":30,"premiered":"1999-01-10","officialSite":null,"schedule":{"time":"","days":["Saturday"]},"rating":{"average":8.8},"weight":94,"network":{"id":71,"name":"The WB","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":2722,"thetvdb":75417,"imdb":"tt0147746"},"image":{"medium":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/4/10842.jpg","original":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/4/10842.jpg"},"summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eBatman Beyond\u003c/b\u003e tells the story of Terry McGinnis was just an ordinary teenager...until his father was mysteriously murdered.
